-- THIS IS NOT A DECK. It is an escalating-chance (bad luck protection) proc, and
-- it rides the deck engine only for the display. SimC models it as:
--
--     chance(k) = min( 0.0663 + 0.0519*(k-1), 0.3949 )
--
-- where k = QUALIFYING harvests since the last proc, and the counter resets on
-- every proc. Set bonus 1296615: effectN(1)=4 (fragment threshold),
-- effectN(2)=20% (the flat fallback). The curve above averages 19.89% over a
-- full cycle, which matches that 20% -- a good sign the fit describes something
-- real. But those three constants are commented "Fitted from PTR logs" in simc
-- (c70a7d002), NOT spell data, so treat them as a hypothesis under test.
--
-- HOW IT MAPS ONTO THE DECK ENGINE (display convention, not mechanics):
--   deckSize   = 8   -- the attempt at which the chance reaches its cap, so the
--                       bar fills as the proc chance ramps up. It is NOT a deck
--                       length and there is no rollover: the cycle ends on a
--                       PROC, never on reaching 8.
--   GetDeckPos = qualifying harvests since the last proc, clamped to 8
--   procs      = 1   -- one proc closes the cycle
--   violations = always 0. A deck "violation" means the deck failed to deliver
--                its promised procs. A capped ramp promises nothing (39.49% is
--                never 100%), so a long streak is legal, not a violation.
--                Reporting one here would cry wolf on normal behaviour.
--
-- THE ATTEMPT GATE. A harvest consuming < 4 fragments neither rolls nor advances
-- the counter. The APL has harvest lines with no souls_consumed>=4 guard, so
-- sub-4 harvests do happen in real play. We count BOTH ways -- gated (delta >= 4)
-- and raw (every harvest) -- and the debugger compares the two hazard curves, so
-- the data itself proves which gate is correct.
--
-- DETECTION (no CDM, nothing secret-unsafe):
--   attempt = UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCEEDED on "player" for Reap/Cull/Eradicate.
--             Player casts are explicitly non-secret in combat.
--   fragments = aura STACKS, not a power type: "Soul Fragments" 1245577,
--             verified in game off the tooltip. Blizzard compares aura
--             .applications unguarded in its own resource bars, so the field is
--             non-secret. Guarded with issecretvalue anyway; an unreadable count
--             degrades that harvest to "unknown", never to a wrong number.
--   proc    = Soulburst buff 1297433 presence transition. Presence only, which
--             is safe even if the struct is secret.
--
-- No pcall. Zero polling.
